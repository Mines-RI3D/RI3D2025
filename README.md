# RI3D2025

2025 RI3D Code for the Mines RI3D team. This is our first year. We only did our Robot CAD and a bit of the code in the initial 72 hr period.

If the team moves forward to manufacture the robot, I'll be completing software, getting the robot usable for demos on campus, and for offseason events. As it stands, this is just a basic subsystem skeleton, with no commands or controls outside of drivebase.

## Notable notes

The robot CAD uses a swerve drivebase. We only have a donated kitbot IRL, so that's what the software here represents. hopefully we get money for swerve eventually.
